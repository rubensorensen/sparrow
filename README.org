* Sparrow

No text editors are perfect. So I am making a perfect one according to my preferences.

Let's see how long I will bother trying to make this.


** Quick start

*** Linux

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/rubensorensen/sparrow.git
  cd sparrow
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make -k -j`nproc`
  ./tests

  # Verify that all tests pass before running the main executable
  ./sparrow
#+END_SRC

*** Windows
Windows support is not a priority at the moment and won't be officially supported in the near future.

**  Contributing
The project is still in its early stages, and I am currently the sole contributor while I'm working on the initial development. In the future I may consider opening up for public contributions.

** License
The project is licensed under the [[https://opensource.org/license/mit/][MIT license]].
